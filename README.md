## Development setup

1. Install git, nodejs, gcc, g++, make \
   Ex (deb):
   ```
   apt install -y git

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
   apt install -y nodejs

   apt install -y gcc g++ make
   ```
2. Clone & install libraries

   `git clone https://github.com/tuxedocomputers/tuxedo-control-center.git`

   `cd tuxedo-control-center`

   `npm install`

   Note: Do *not* continue with `npm audit fix`. Known to cause various issues.

3. Install service file that points to development build path (or use installed service from packaged version)
   
   Manual instructions:
   1. Copy `tccd.service` and `tccd-sleep.service` (from src/dist-data) to `/etc/systemd/system/`
   2. Edit the `tccd.service` (exec start/stop) to point to `<dev path>/dist/tuxedo-control-center/data/service/tccd`.
   3. Copy `com.tuxedocomputers.tccd.conf` to `/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d/`
   4. Start service `systemctl start tccd`. (And enable for autostart `systemctl enable tccd tccd-sleep`)
