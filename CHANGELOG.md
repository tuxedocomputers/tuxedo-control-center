# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2021-08-26
### Added
- Profiles: *System profile* selection for TCC profiles for certain devices (more to come).
  The system profiles usually affect power allowance and sometimes fan control when not
  using the TCC fan control.
- Profiles: Fan control parameter *Minimum fan speed* applied to existing fan curves.
- Profiles: Fan control parameter *Offset fan speed* applied to existing fan curves.
- Togglable visualization of fan curves.
- AMD (amdgpu): Chroma subsampling activation for external displays (experimental).
  Usable on many AMD CPU devices without discrete graphics card.
- Tray: Menu option to activate a profile temporarily.
- Tray: Menu option to toggle temporary powersave prevention.
- Tools: GUI for changing crypt password.
- Option to turn off TCC fan control in global settings.
- Option to turn off TCC CPU control in global settings.

### Changed
- TCC GUI title now using window manager default title.
- Better hiding of not available options for clarity both regarding
  available devices and features for these.
- Theme selection moved to settings.
- *Settings* button moved from tools to menu side.

### Fixed
- *Cool and breezy*/*Extreme powersave* profiles that in certain cases did not apply
  the CPU limits properly.
- Unreliable CPU info max freq for AMD devices sometimes yields max non boost freq
  sometimes boost freq and sometimes a seemingly random number depending on which
  kernel used around 5.11. Now changed to consistently use available freqs.

## [1.0.14] - 2021-05-20
### Added
- Systeminfo clarifications
  - Third clear *done* step when finished sending
  - Blurring while asking for password/working
  - Not possible to send again without going through *step 1*

### Fixed

  is found to be smaller than the default width/height
- Minimize icon size

## [1.0.13] - 2021-04-23
### Changed
- Max frequency for AMD CPUs clarified as 'boost' instead of max
  base frequency. Additionally now max frequency for these devices can be
  set to max base frequency with or without boost.
- Now using 'same speed' approach for fan control on all devices. This means
  that the same speed will be used for all fans. The speed written will be
  the highest decided from each individual sensor. This should better
  share the cooling between multiple fans where available.
- Fantables updated
  - Minimum 'on' fanspeeds now at 20% to make sure fans start better over all
  - Freezy fan profile now always on and even more freezy for those
    warm spring days

  there is not one temp sensor per fan
